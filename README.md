A seamless, rich-text writing experience for Obsidian. Built for users who want the power of Markdown without the visual clutter of raw syntax.
The plugin is using a customized version of MDXEditor.
## Why this exists?
I made this because editing text quickly on a phone became very cumbersome. For example, trying to delete a checklist item, forces you to delete all the symbols for that item (`- [ ]`). With MDXEditor, that just takes a backspace. 
And I thought, how hard can it be to implement that into obsidian. It's just html right?
Well, it took a bit to make it work nice with obsidian and to mimic everything to make it feel and look like obsidian. But I feel it works quite well for what it is.

While I do like the control you get from the regular WYSIWYG editor of obsidian, it makes it quite a hassle when trying to edit text quickly. 
Luckily changing between the editor is just one click away!
## Key Features
* **Code-Free Editing:** No more looking at code when writing text. Edit them visually, just like a modern word processor.
* **Obsidian Integration:** Integrated seamlessly with Obsidian's native UI and workflows.
* **Obsidian look and feel:** I tried to replicate the look of obsidian as much as I can, so the workflow is as familiar as possible.
* **Mobile support:** With toolbar just over your keyboard, just what you are used to. Tested on iOS, but should be working on android

## Installation
Install the plugin via Community Plugins in obsidian.
or
manually download from the releases page and extract into a plugins in your vault.
## Going forward
My plan was to just make it easier for me to use my phone with obsidian with my workflows. And I feel the plugin is in a state where it has what I need.
But it means that it might be lacking some things that you want. 
I would very much appreciate forks and contributions if you would like to see new features in the plugin.
